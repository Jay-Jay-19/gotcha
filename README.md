<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ✨ ABOUT THE PROJECT
<p>
  I wanted to learn React Native by creating my very first mobile app. Since I love food, it was only natural that I tried to make a food delivery application 🤤 <br />
  
  What I learned and implemented over the course of this project :<br />
  
- 🔑 Relational database : thanks to Sanity, a powerful and efficient content platform that serves as the backend.<br />
- 📱🔄🖥️ Cross-platform coding : thanks to React Native, only one codebase is developped for web app, Android and iOS.<br />
- 🏪 App state management : thanks to Redux and its 3 core concepts, Store / Action / Reducers.<br />
- 💫 Seamless navigation between all the app screens : thanks to React Navigation library.
</p>
